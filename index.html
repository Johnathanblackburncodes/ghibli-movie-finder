            While protecting his village from a rampaging boar-god, the young
            warrior Ashitaka becomes afflicted with a deadly curse. To find the
            cure that will save his life, he journeys deep into sacred depths of
            the Great Forest Spirit's realm where he meets San (Princess
            Mononoke), a girl raised by wolves. It's not long before Ashitaka is
            caught in the middle of a battle between iron-ore prospecting humans
            and the forest dwellers. He must summon the spirit-powers and all
            his courage to stop man and nature from destroying each other.
